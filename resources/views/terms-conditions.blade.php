				The cost of our main, pre and post trips includes no travel insurance. Adequate and valid travel insurance is mandatory for all clients while on one of our trips. You are strongly advised to insure yourself against any possible risk that may occur while in Peru and in particular to ensure that you have sufficient coverage for medical emergency, medical evacuation caused by altitude and high altitude or any other unforeseeable circumstance such as death, repatriation, or cancellation of your trip due to illness before the trip starts (whether it is your own illness or that of an immediate family member or traveling companion.) You should purchase a policy that provides financial compensation, refunds and benefits in case of trip cancellation, travel delay, luggage delay or loss. You are responsible for insuring all activities included in the itineraries of our pre, post and main trips for the entire duration of the tour. DHSG E.I.R.L. will not be responsible for costs you may incur as a result of not having adequate travel insurance.

				Cancellation Fee Schedule <br> 
				Up to 91 days prior to departure: We don’t charge one! Just the reservation deposit.<br> 
				61-90 days prior to departure: 25% of trip cost plus reservation deposit <br> 
				46-60 days prior to departure: 50% of trip cost plus reservation deposit <br> 
				45 days or less: 100% of trip cost. <br> 
				The refund will be made from a Peruvian bank with a deposit of the total amount of your refund balance, DHSG E.I.R.L. will not cover any transaction charges by your bank for the wired money nor guarantee the amount of money that you receive at your bank. Your bank may impose transaction charges for the wired money.
